Scalite
=======

**Scalite** is an experimental whitespace-delimited syntax for the scala programming language. This lets you delimit block scope using indentation rather than curly braces, reducing the amount of unnecessary curly braces within the source code.

Check out the (small number of) working examples in the [tests](src/test/resources/scalite) folder, or read previous discussion on the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-language/yl9BRqlpjJ0).

Scalite is the culmination of 10 hours of work, and isn't ready to be used for anything at all.
